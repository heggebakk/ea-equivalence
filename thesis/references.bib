	abstract = {We investigate a construction in which a vectorial Boolean function G is obtained from a given function F over F 2 n \${\textbackslash}mathbb F\_2{\textasciicircum}n\$ by changing the values of F at two points of the underlying field. In particular, we examine the possibility of obtaining one {APN} function from another in this way. We characterize the {APN}-ness of G in terms of the derivatives and in terms of the Walsh coefficients of F. We establish that changing two points of a function F over F 2 n \${\textbackslash}mathbb F\_2{\textasciicircum}n\$ which is plateaued (and, in particular, {AB}) or of algebraic degree d e g(F) {\textless} n − 1 can never give a plateaued (and {AB}, in particular) function for any n ≥ 5. We also examine a particular case in which we swap the values of F at two points of F 2 n \${\textbackslash}mathbb F\_2{\textasciicircum}n\$ . This is motivated by the fact that such a construction allows us to obtain one permutation from another. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the {APN}-ness of G which we then use to show that swapping two points of any power function over a field F 2 n \${\textbackslash}mathbb F\_2{\textasciicircum}n\$ with n ≥ 5 can never produce an {APN} function. We also list some experimental results indicating that the same is true for the switching classes from Edel and Pott (Adv. Math. Commun. 3(1):59–81, 2009), and conjecture that the Hamming distance between two {APN} functions cannot be equal to two for n ≥ 5.},
